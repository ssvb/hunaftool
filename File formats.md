## `.udic` file extension

The same as `.dic`, but:
 * always uses UTF-8
 * has no counter in the first line
 * comments start from '#'. More specifically: either the first character in a line or preceeded by a space or a tab.
   Two '##' in the position of a comment mean just an escaped '#' character.
